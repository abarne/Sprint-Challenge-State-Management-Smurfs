What problem does the context API help solve?
    Helps with passing data from child to parent.

In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
    reducers let us manipulate our state, actions tell the reducer how to manipulate it, and store is what lets all components use state.

What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
    component state is stored within the component and not accessible from other components, unless passed on as props. Application state is used by all components, and can be useful
    for bigger projects with many components that need to access the same data in state.

Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators?
    it is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object

What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
    Redux is my favorite so far, it may seem excessive for our small projects, but its scalability seems to be very useful.
